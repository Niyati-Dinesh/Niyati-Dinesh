### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Niyati Dinesh Bhatt**](https://github.com/Niyati-Dinesh), a full-stack web developer and computer science student based in India.

I'm currently pursuing an Integrated MCA at [**Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham**](https://www.amrita.edu/), with a strong focus on full-stack development, cybersecurity, and problem-solving.

I’m building projects using the **MERN stack**, and currently working on **SnippetVault**, a developer-focused snippet manager. I’ve also completed certified tracks in Python, C, and cybersecurity, and I’m joining [**Infosys**](https://www.infosys.com/) as a Python Development Intern.

I’m interested in backend development, web security, and building clean, scalable apps.

Outside of tech , I'm intrested playing Guitar, Keyboard, and Singing.
